## Install these dependencies before continuing

-  [Nodejs version](https://nodejs.org/en/) - version 10.15.3
-  [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) -version 3.5.5

## Installation

**- Go to the project's root folder and run the command:**

```
npm install
```

This will install the ```node-modules``` folder & the ```package.json``` dependencies.

**- After that, run the command:**
